The WDEF files will define files to add to the Resource section.

WDEF lines will have the general format:
 // comment
 lumpname=filename [conv]

Where, filename will give the path to the resource file relative to the build location (as with normal source files).

Lumps will be exposed to C land with symbols having the name "__rsrc__lumpname", where in this case lumpname will be limited to a character range such that the result is a valid C identifier.

Within RWAD, there will also be an implicit name length limit of 16 characters, and lump names should not include file extensions (though, RWAD will remember a FOURCC associated with the file type).


The conv parameter will be optional, and will have the format:
 fmt[,arg=val]*

This will specify a format that the loaded resource should be converted into.
If absent, the original file will be imported as-is.

Where, fmt may be one of:
* bmp8: BMP image with 8 bits/pixel (256-Color Fixed palette)
* bmp4: BMP image with 4 bits/pixel (RGBI palette)
* bmp2: BMP image with 2 bits/pixel (4 shade Monochrome)
* bmp1: BMP image with 1 bits/pixel (Monochrome)
* bmp8a: BMPA image with 8 bits/pixel (Fixed palette)
* bmp4a: BMPA image with 4 bits/pixel (RGBI palette)
* bmp2a: BMPA image with 2 bits/pixel (4 shade Monochrome)
* bmp1a: BMPA image with 1 bits/pixel (Monochrome)
* bmp2t: BMP image with 2 bits/pixel (Black/White/Gray/Transparent)
* bmp2ta: BMPA image with 2 bits/pixel (Black/White/Gray/Transparent)
* bmp4t: BMP image with 4 bits/pixel (Transparent)
* bmp4ta: BMPA image with 4 bits/pixel (Transparent)

* bmp16: BMP with 16 bits/pixel (RGB555)
* bmp16a: BMPA with 16 bits/pixel (RGB555)
* bmp32: BMP with 32 bits/pixel (BGRA)
* bmp32a: BMPA with 32 bits/pixel (BGRA)

* bmp_cram8: BMP with 8-bit CRAM encoding.
* bmp_cram8a: BMPA with 8-bit CRAM encoding.

* qoi: QOI Format
* qoli: QOLI (QOI with inline LZ compression)
* lcif: LCIF Format
* upic: UPIC Format

BMPA is a modified BMP differing mostly in that the fields and image data will be aligned. The headers will have a native 32-bit alignment, whereas the image data will have a 64-bit alignment. The magic will be changed from 'BM' to ' BMP', but apart from the alignment change the format is basically the same.

The 256 color palette will include a designated transparent color (encoded in the palette with an alpha of 0). During encoding, any pixels with an alpha less than 128 will be assumed transparent, and any with more than 128 will be opaque.

For 16 color and 4 color, the Transparent versions will be separate and sacrifice 1 color for transparency. For 4-color, this will only have a single shade of gray; for 16 color, the Hi-Magenta (Color 13) will be replaced with a transparent color.

For BMP16 and BMP16A, the MSB of each pixel will encode Alpha:
* 0rrrrrgggggbbbbb  (A=255)
* 1rrrraggggabbbba  (8 levels of alpha, 16 of R/G/B)


For QOI and QOLI, a 'q' parameter will speficy a lossy quality level (0=lossless, 1=best, 7=worst). The default will be lossless.

For LCIF and UPIC, the 'q' parameter will speficy a lossy quality level (0=best, 7=worst). The default will be best.

Both QOI and LCIF will include an full Alpha channel.


=== BMP: 8-bit CRAM ===

This will encode the image as a stream of bytes, using a variant of the CRAM (MS Video 1) encoding.

The first two bytes from each encoded block may be interpreted as a 16-bit word:
* 0000..7FFF aa bb: 2-color block.
** Two color endpoints follow the 16-bit word.
** The word represents a 4x4x1 color-cell, selecting each pixel.
** If a bit is set, use color aa, else bb.
** Bit ordering is LSB first.
* 80cc..83cc: Flat color block (only contains 1 color).
** Only 80cc will be used in this variant.
* 84nn..87nn: Skip Blocks, Unused
* 88zz..8Fzz: Flat/Reserved, Unused.
* 9000..FFFF aa bb cc dd ee ff gg hh: 8-color block (Unused here).
** Each 2x2x1 sub-block selects between colors in a color pair.
*** ef gh
*** ab cd

Note that alpha masking may be encoded in this format by using a designated transparent color. In these blocks, the selection will be between transparent and another non-transparent color (the average of the other non-transparent colors in the block).
