Simplified FRBC intended mostly as a 3AC IR for object files.

VLI:
*     0..  127	0xxxxxxx
*   128..16383	10xxxxxx xxxxxxxx
* 16384..   2M	110xxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
*    2M.. 256M	1110xxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx
* ...


Register:
* VLI Value, Low 2 bits as a tag
** 0=Temporary
** 1=Arg
** 2=Local
** 3=Global/Immediate
* Above the tag will be a sequence number:
** Encoded as an inline Rice(2)
* Above the sequence number will be the register ID number.
** The ID will use the remaining bits

The sequence number will indicate which version of a given register is used.
* Assigning to a register gives it a new sequence value.
* A block where multiple paths converge may also increment a registers' sequence.
** This will be known as a 'phi' operation.


Sequence Numbering will not be used with gloabals or immediates, instead an Rice(2) tag will indicate the type of value.
* 0: Imm Int
* 1: Imm Long
* 2: Imm Float
* 3: Imm Double
* 4: Imm String
* 5: Imm WString
* 6: Literal ID
* 7: Global ID
