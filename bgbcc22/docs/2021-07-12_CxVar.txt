CxVar
* C Variant with extended features (BGBCC).
* Adds a dynamic type system.
* Add class/instance OO.
* Adds preprocessor extensions.


=== Core C Type Extensions ===

Types:
* __int128, 128 bit signed integer.
* __uint128, 128 bit unsigned integer.
* _BitInt(n), Bit sized integer.
** May use a native type for smaller integer sizes.
** May support much larger virtual integer types.
* __float128, 128-bit floating point number

Printf:
* I(n), type modifier, specify a given sized value.
** "%I32d" maps to "%d", specifies a 32-bit value
** "%I64d" maps to "%lld", specifies a 64-bit value
** "%I128d" allows printing __int128 values.
* 'v' | 'V': Print a '__variant' value.

=== Preprocessor Extensions ===

Block Macro:
 # defmacro NAME  //block macro (no args)
 ...
 # endmacro
 
 # defmacro NAME(ARGS)  //block macro (with args)
 ...
 # endmacro
 
 # assign NAME EXPR		//computed redefine

A block macro will define a macro which spans multiple lines.

The assign directive line will evaluate the expression and define the result.
If the define already exists, it will be replaced with the new value.

Note that certain preprocessor directive, namely if/ifdef/else/endif, are allowed within the body of a block macro. These will be evaluated at the time the macro is declared, and as such will modify the contents of the macro.


Macro Scripts:
  # macroed
  ...
  # endmacro
  #`` EXPR

Macro scripts will represent small programs with a JS-like syntax.
These programs will be evaluated in the preprocessor, and may produce output
which is piped back into the preprocessor.

The macroed block will behave similar to a block macro.

Macroed Statements:
 var NAME;  //declare a variable
 var NAME = VALUE;  //declare a variable with a value.
 function NAME(ARGS) { ... BODY ... }  //function

Wirh some built-in functions defined:
 isDefined("NAME");  //returns boolean true if a preprocessor define exists.
 getDefineStr("NAME");  //get the value string of a define
 addDefineStr("NAME", "VALUE");  //assign the value string of a define.
 print("PATTERN", VALUES);  //print a format string (fed back into PP output)
 echo(VALUES);  //print a series of values to the PP output.
 

=== Dynamic Types ===

New Type Keywords:
* __var:
** Value is either dynamically typed or type-inferred.
** The __var keyword may also introduce some other constructs.

* __variant:
** Variant is a dynamically typed value.
** Nominally represented as a 64-bit tagged reference value.
* __object:
** Same format as variant, but is opaque and does not allow operators.
* __string:
** Same format as variant, but only holds string type values.
* __boxint:
** Same format as variant, but only holds boxint values.


Dynamic typed values will represent their own set of types:
* fixnum: Nominally 62-bits, signed integer.
* flonum: Nominally 62-bits, floating point number.
* string: Literal string.
* tagarr: Reference type array;
* tagobj: Associative dictionary object.
* boxint: Large Boxed Integer Type (128 to 384 bits).

Tagged Arrays are always 1-dimensional, and may contain various primitive types (including object and variant). Note that non-primitive types will generally be stored in the same format as object and variant.

Casting a value to or from object or variant will attempt to type-convert the value.
* Casting from other tagged-pointer types will copy the value unchanged.
* Integer or Floating point types will be converted to fixnum or flonum.
* Casting pointer types will be assumed to be object pointers.
** The type-tag will be fetched from the corresponding heap allocation.
** Casting a pointer to variant is undefined if the pointer is not a heap object.


Many operators may also be used on variant values, and will behave similarly to operators on primitive types. Operators between fixnum values will operate on fixnum, and will be 62-bit sign modular (twos complement).

Note that long values outside of the fixnum range may be truncated if cast to variant. It will be necessary to cast to boxint instead if a larger value is needed.


Variant will define or redefine a few operators:
* a==b / a!=b, Compare by value (Soft)
** Values of compatible types may be compared after conversion to a common type.
* a===b / a!==b, Compare by identity (Hard)
** Values are compared using the literal bit-pattern in the tagged reference.
** Values will only compare equal if they refer to the same object.
* a &gt;&gt; b, Signed right shift (integer types)
* a &gt;&gt;&gt; b, Unsigned signed right shift (integer types)

As well as add new operators:
* OBJ __instanceof TYPE
** Check if an object is an instance of a given type.
* __new TYPE [ SIZE ]
** Create new tag array with a given size.


=== Object System ===

An object system with single inheritance and interfaces will be defined.
* Object instances in this system will use tagged references.

New Keywords:
* __class NAME [ __extends SUPER ] [ __implements LIST ] { BODY }
** Define a new class.
** A class may extend a single superclass.
** A class may implement zero or more interfaces.
* __interface NAME { BODY }
** Define a new interface.
* __public: Mark a field as public
* __private: Mark a field as private
* __protected: Mark a field as protected
* __virtual: Mark a method as virtual.
* __final: Mark a method or field as final.
* __new CLASS(CTOR_ARGS)
** Create a new Class Instance.
* OBJ __instanceof CLASS
** Check if an object is an instance of a given class.
* OBJ __instanceof IFACE
** Check if an object implements a given interface.

Methods may be unmarked, virtual, or final.

An unmarked method will be either virtual or final.
* An final method may not be overridden in a child class.
* A virtual method may be overriden in a child class.
* Overriding an unmarked method is undefined.


=== Lambda Expressions ===

Lambda expressions will create a function as an expression.

These will come in several syntactic variants:
* __var ( args ) : type { body }
* __var! ( args ) : type { body }
* __function { body }
* __function! { body }
* __function ( args ) : type { body }
* __function! ( args ) : type { body }
* __function [ capture_list ] ( args ) : type { body }
* __function! [ capture_list ] ( args ) : type { body }
* [ capture_list ] { body }						//C23 Style
* [ capture_list ] ( args ) -> type { body }	//C23 Style

With several sub-variants:
* Nothing is captured.
** This case is semantically equivalent to a bare function.
** The value generated is a bare function pointer.
* Variables are captured, lambda is dynamically allocated.
** A heap allocated object is created, not automatically destroyed.
** This scenario may leak memory of the lambda is not freed.
* Variables are captured, lambda has automatic lifetime.
** The lambda will be implicitly destroyed when the parent function returns.

The __var and __function versions will create a lambda with dynamic lifetime.
The __var! and __function! versions will create a lambda with automatic lifetime.

The C23 style lambdas will have automatic lifetime by default.

A capture list may give either an implicit capture mode, or a list of variables to be captured.
* [   ]  Capture Nothing.
* [ = ]  Capture implicitly by value.
* [ name ]  Capture a named variable (explicit).
* [ name = expr ]  Create a capture variable containing the result of an expression.

For forms without a capture list, it will behave as if the list were [ = ] by default. These will fall back to the no-capture case if nothing is captured.
