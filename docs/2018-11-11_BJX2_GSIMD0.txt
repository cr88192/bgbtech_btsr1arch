BJX2 GPR SIMD
* Uses GPRs as SIMD Registers.
* Mostly focus on Packed-WORD SIMD.


PACKHI.W2B Rm, Rn
  Rn = { 32'h0, Rm[63:56], Rm[47:40], Rm[31:24], Rm[15:8] };

Pack four words into four bytes, using the high 8 bits of each word.


PACKHI.B2W Rm, Rn
	Rn = {	Rm[31:24], 16'h0,
			Rm[23:16], 16'h0,
			Rm[15: 8], 16'h0,
			Rm[ 7: 0], 16'h0	};

Unpack four bytes into four words, moving each byte into the high 8 bits of each word.


PACKLZ.W2B Rm, Rn
PACKLZ.B2W Rm, Rn

Similar to the PACKHI case, but using the low 8 bits.
Converting byte to word will zero extend, converting word to byte will saturate.


PACKLS.W2B Rm, Rn
PACKLS.B2W Rm, Rn

Similar to PACKLZ, but with sign-extension and signed saturate.


PADDW Rm, Rn

Packed Add Words.
