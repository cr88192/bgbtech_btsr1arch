Optimization Probability Ranking Table:
* Assume an already entropy coded source.
* Try to squeeze additional entropy out of it.
* But, moderately fast and efficiently.

Premise:
* One has an order-1 model;
** There is a context for each preceding byte.
** Symbol probabilities are ranked according to STF.
* Keep track of a "median index" for each context.
** If encoded index is less than median, decrement median.
** If encoded index is greated than median, increment median.
* Depending on the median index, use an entropy encoding.
** 60..255: Indedx as raw 8 bits.
** 00..5F: Rank2

Rank2 (LSB First):
* 0xxxxxx       //00..3F, 7
* 10xxxxxx      //40..7F, 8
* 11xxxxxxx     //80..FF, 9
