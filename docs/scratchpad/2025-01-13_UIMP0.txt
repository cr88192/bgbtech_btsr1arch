UIMP0:
* Multi-purpose Messaging Protocol.
* Intended for point-to-point message routing over a link.
** Network socket or serial link.
** Try to be compatible with sending other data over the same link.
* May carry other protocols.

In its basic form, this will assume a 7-bit ASCII transport.
* Message Start: "%UIxx~"
** With xx as the message length (Base64X).
** Will be given as a count of logical 32-bit words.
* Message End: "~xxx~"
** With xxx as a message check value (Base41X).
* Geneal message data is Base85 encoded.

Base64X:
* 31..70
** Groups of 2 encode 12 bits.
** Groups of 4 encode 24 bits

Base41X:
* 31..59
** Groups of 3 encode 16 bits.

Base85:
* 21..75: Groups of 5 characters encode 32 bits.
* 79: 20202020
* 7A: 00000000
