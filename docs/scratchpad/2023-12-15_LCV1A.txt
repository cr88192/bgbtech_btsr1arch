Low Complexity Video 1A
* Goal is to make something that is a suitable alternative to CRAM.
** Should not be significantly slower.
** Should not be significantly more complicated.

Ideas:
* Split color and block planes (like LCIF)
* Focus on 2x RGB555 and 4x4x2 as top-end.

Color Plane:
* rrrrrggg-ggbbbbbr-rrrrgggg-gbbbbb00  RGB555 Pair
*                   rrgggbbr-rgggbb10  RGB555 Pair Delta
*                            iiiii001  Endpoint Index
*                            nnnn0101  Endpoint RLE Run
*                            nnnn1101  Endpoint Skip Run
*                   dddddddd-nnnn0011  Endpoint LZ (Short)
*                   nnnnnnnn-nn001011  Endpoint RLE Run (Long)
*                   nnnnnnnn-nn101011  Endpoint Skip (Long)

Whenever a new color endpoint pair is encoded, it will be added to a rotating list, an index may be encoded into this list.

The RLE Run case can be considered an LZ Run where the distance is fixed at 1.
The Endpoint Index can be considered an LZ run where the length is fixed at 1.

Color pairs will consist of colors A and B, which range between 0 and 3:
* 00: Color B
* 01: 5/8 Color B + 3/8 Color A
* 10: 3/8 Color B + 5/8 Color A
* 11: Color A

Nominally, patterns will unpack into 4x4x2 blocks, but may be compacted further.

Block Plane:
*                           iiiiii00  Recent Block Index
*                           pppppp10  Fixed Block Pattern
*                           iiii0001  Flat Run (C=0)
*                           iiii1001  Flat Run (C=3)
*                           nnnn0101  Block RLE Run
*                           nnnn1101  Block Skip Run
*                  dddddddd-nnnn0011  Block LZ (Short)
*                  nnnnnnnn-nn001011  Block RLE Run (Long)
*                  nnnnnnnn-nn101011  Block Skip (Long)
*                           nn011011  1x-4x 8x(1x1x1)
*                           nn111011  1x-4x 4x(1x1x2)
*                           nn000111  1x-4x 2x2x2
*                           nn100111  1x-4x 4x4x1
*                           nn010111  1x-4x 4x4x2
*                           nn110111  1x-4x -
