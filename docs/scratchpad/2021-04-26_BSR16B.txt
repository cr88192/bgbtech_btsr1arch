BSR16: 16-bit BSR variant (possible, B).
* Intended as a possible IO coprocessor for BJX2

Overview:
* 16-bit instructions;
* 16x 16-bit GPRs
** Most ALU ops will be 16-bit
** Segmented address space: CS/PBR and DS/GBR
* GPRs may (in certain cases) be used as 32-bit pairs.

Issue:
* How to access MMIO and the bus.
