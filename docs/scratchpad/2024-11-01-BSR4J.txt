BSE4J: Writing this down mostly for completion.
* Would have been a slightly cheaper way to glue XG2 onto RV64.
* Would have still left the encoding a bit dog-chewed.

Premise:
* Low 16 bits are remapped:
** NMOP-YwYY-nnnn-mmmm => NMOY-mmmm-nnnn-YYPw
* High 16-bits left as-is.

I ended up going with BSR4K as a possible "XG3" mostly because:
* It could reduce the amount of dog-chew in the encoding scheme;
* Unlike BSR4I, it could reuse the existing decoders.
