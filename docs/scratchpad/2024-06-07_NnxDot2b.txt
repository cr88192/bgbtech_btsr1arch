Two Bit Dot Product:
* Multiply a series 16x of 2-bit values with 3 bit weights and accumulate.

The 2-bit values:
* 00:  0
* 01:  1
* 10:  0
* 11: -1

The 3-bit values:
* 000..011: 0/ 1/ 2/ 3
* 100..111: 0/-1/-2/-3

The accumulated value will be added against an 8-bit bias, with the output being given as 1 or -1 depending on the result.
