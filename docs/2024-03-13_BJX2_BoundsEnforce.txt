Bounds Check Enforcing Mode (BCE):
* Sub-Mode that enforces bounds-checking.
* Only XMOV.x instructions will be allowed in this mode.
** Albeit likely using a 48-bit address space, with 128-bit pointers.
* Memory locations and registers will remember whether they contain valid pointers.
** Modifying the bits in a register will lose its status as a pointer.
** Modifying memory will lose the validity status of a pointer.
** Trying to access memory through a pointer without it being valid, will fault.

Rules:
* Loads with GBR or PC as a base will be allowed.
* Most other non-XMOV memory accesses will not.
* GBR will be Read-Only.

Internal:
* Registers will be tagged to whether or not they contain capabilities;
* Memory locations will be tagged as to whether or not they contain capabilities.

System Visible:
* 0x0000BF80..0x0000BFFF: Will contain Tag Bits for the SRAM area.
** This area will always contain zeroes is BCE mode is not supported.
