TestKern True Type Font
* Aim to be a simpler font format.
* Change: BGTF (Geometric Type Font)
* May use a ".GTF" file extension.

General structure:
* Organize space into "pages" of 256 glyphs;
* Top-level structure gives offset to each page;
* Each page contains an offset to the start of each glyph;
* Each glyph exists as a series of 32-bit words.

For each glyph word, the high 4 bits will give a tag:
* 0: Command (Data)
* 1: Inerior Vertex (Not Start or End)
* 2: Start of Shape/Contour (Vertex)
* 3: End of Shape/Contour (Vertex)

Vertex:
* (11: 0): X Position
* (23:12): Y Position
* (   24): Curve
* (   25): Smoothing Hint
* (   26): Offcurve
* (   27): MBZ
* (31:28): Tag

The Vertex X and Y coords will be between -2048 and 2047.

If a point is Curve:
* It will be a control point for a Quadratic B-Spline.
* The previous and next points will be the reference vertices;
* Will wrap if the first or last vertex in the contour.

Commands:
* (23: 0): Command Data
* (27:24): Command ID
* (31:28): Tag

Command 0:
* If Data is 000000, End of Glyph
* Else: Reserved

Command 1: Component Key Point / NOP
* Interpret as NOP

Command 4/5/6/7:
* 4: Logical Size (Data: X and Y)
* 5: Logical Origin (Data: X and Y)
* 6: Bound Mins
* 7: Bound Maxs

Commands 4/5/6/7 will come before the first contour.

Command 0 will come following the last contour.


Page:
* Each page will consist of 256 32-bit words;
* These will give the offset of the start of each glyph;
* Entries holding 0 will be absent;
* Offsets are given in 32-bit words.

Page Directory:
* Same general structure as a Page;
* Holds the offset of the start of each page;
* If an offset is 0, this page does not exist.

File Header:
* Word 0: Magic at start of file 'BGTF'
* Word 1: Offset of Page Directory;
* Word 2: Offset of Global Words.

Global Words:
* Similar structure to Commands.
* Give some general parameters for the font as a whole.
* Terminated by a 0 word.

Global Command 1:
* Gives logical size of "Em Glyph"
