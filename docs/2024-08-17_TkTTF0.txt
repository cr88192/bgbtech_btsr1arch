TestKern True Type Font
* Aim to be a simpler font format.
* Change: BGTF (Geometric Type Font)
* May use a ".GTF" file extension.

General structure:
* Organize space into "pages" of 256 glyphs;
* Top-level structure gives offset to each page;
* Each page contains an offset to the start of each glyph;
* Each glyph exists as a series of 32-bit words.

For each glyph word, the high 4 bits will give a tag:
* 0: Command (Data)
* 1: Inerior Vertex (Not Start or End)
* 2: Start of Shape/Contour (Vertex)
* 3: End of Shape/Contour (Vertex)

Vertex:
* (31:28): Tag
* (   27): MBZ
* (   26): Offcurve
* (   25): Smoothing Hint
* (   24): Curve
* (23:12): Y Position
* (11: 0): X Position

The Vertex X and Y coords will be between -2048 and 2047.

If a point is Curve:
* It will be a control point for a Quadratic B-Spline.
* The previous and next points will be the reference vertices;
* Will wrap if the first or last vertex in the contour.

Commands:
* (31:28): Tag
* (27:24): Command ID
* (23: 0): Command Data

Command 0:
* If Data is 000000, End of Glyph
* Else: Reserved

Command 1: Component Key Point / NOP
* Interpret as NOP

Command 4/5/6/7:
* 4: Logical Size (Data: X and Y)
* 5: Logical Origin (Data: X and Y)
* 6: Bound Mins
* 7: Bound Maxs

Commands 4/5/6/7 will come before the first contour.

Command 0 will come following the last contour.


Page (Raw):
* Each page will consist of 256 32-bit words;
* These will give the offset of the start of each glyph;
* Entries holding 0 will be absent;
* Offsets are given in 32-bit words.

Page Directory:
* Same general structure as a Page;
* Holds the offset of the start of each page;
* If an offset is 0, this page does not exist.

The Page and Page Directory may be either Raw or Compacted.

If the table is Raw:
* It will contain 256 words, holding offsets.
* The high 8 bits of each entry are to be zeroed.

If the tables are Compacted:
* (31:24): Logical Table Index
* (23: 0): Offset
* Entries are to be be in ascending order by index.
* A NULL entry will be present at the end of the table.
* A NULL entry will appear before the start of the table.

The NULL entry for compacted tables will have all Offset bits set to 0.
* The high 8 bits will be non-zero.
* For the entry preceding the table, it will give the number of entries-1.
* For the entry at the end of the table, the high 8 bits are undefined.
* Dense tables may be packed end-to-end, with shared NULL entries.

A Compacted table may not begin with two Zero Index entries. If there is a single entry and it is 0, then the NULL entry may not also be 0.


File Header:
* Word 0: Magic at start of file 'BGTF'
* Word 1: Offset of Page Directory;
* Word 2: Offset of Global Words.

Global Words:
* Similar structure to Commands.
* Give some general parameters for the font as a whole.
* Terminated by a 0 word.

Global Commands
* 1: Gives logical size of "Em Glyph"
* 6: Bound Mins (All Glyphs)
* 7: Bound Maxs (All Glyphs)
