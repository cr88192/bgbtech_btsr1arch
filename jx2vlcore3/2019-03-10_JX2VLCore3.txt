Attempt more fundamental redesigns to reduce costs and hopefully improve timing.

Pipeline:
  IF ID1 ID2 EX MA WB

Will use a 32-bit address space, with the high 32 bits of addresses being ignored.
Memory access will use fixed register ports for AGU.

Pretty much everything can use two GPR ports apart from "MOV.x Rm, (Rn, Ri)".
Maybe try to find a workaround to use a 2-port approach, eg:
  MOV Rm, R0
  MOV.x R0, (Rn, Ri)

Register Numbering:
  5 or 6 bit, 00..1F=GPRs
  Need special cases: PC, GBR, IMM, ZZR
    Mem Base: PC, GBR
    Index: IMM, ZZR
    ALU: IMM, ZZR (Both Ports)

R0, R1, and R15 are special.
R16, R17, and R31 are also special, but don't yet have special behavior.

Possible (6b scheme):
  00..1F: Direct GPRs (GPR Array)
  20..3F: Special GPRs (Case Block)

Special handling for R0, R1, and R15 is handled in decoder.
  R0 ->R32=DLR
  R1 ->R33=DHR
  R15->R47=SP
  
  R48=PC
  R49=GBR
  R63=ZZR



ExUnit:
  Contains L1 Cache;
  L2 and MMIO bus are external.
  Split off MMIO at L1.
