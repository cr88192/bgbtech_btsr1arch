FUNCTION:
    Fixed32 FixedSqrtHP(Fixed32 n);
DESCRIPTION:
    This does a high-precision square root of a Fixed32.  It has
    8.16 bit accuracy.  For more speed use FixedSqrtLP().


FUNCTION:
    Fixed32 FixedSqrtLP(Fixed32 n);
DESCRIPTION:
    This does a low-precision square root of a Fixed32.  It has
    8.8 bit accuracy.  For more accuracy use FixedSqrtHP().
