NPC Script:
* Will use a notation with a vaguely similar structure to MediaWiki or Markdown.
* Will primarily represent dialog trees and sequences of events.
** Raw lines of text will be printed via dialog boxes.
** Link choices may be provided.
* Will generally be processed one line at a time.


Notation:
 = ScriptName =
 Gives the name of a script, if multiple scripts exist in a file.
 Otherwise, ScriptName will be assumed to identify the name of a script file.
 
 When a script is run, this section will be executed first.
 
 == Label / Heading ==
 === Label / Heading ===
   Describes a label or heading.
   When used in a dialog tree, it is not normally displayed.
 
 /command options
   Command to be executed.
  
 * [[Target]]
 * [[Target|DialogText]]
 Dialog option linking to a given target.
 Target will take the form of:
   ScriptName
   ScriptName#Label
   #Label
 If no dialog text is given, the script or label name will be displayed by itself.
 If no star is used, this is treated as a direct jump (no delay).
 If only a single option is given, no option is shown.
   Wait for user input then jump.
 
 (expr) ? Action
 (expr) ? Action : ElseAction
 Evaluate expression, then perform Action based on the result.
 Expressions will have a similar notation to commands.

Expressions:
* Expressions may nest in a similar way to S-Expression syntax.
* has_item ItemName MinCount
** True if user has at least MinCount versions it Item in their inventory.
* and (expr1) (expr2) ...
* or (expr1) (expr2) ...
** Logical relation between expressions.
* not (expr)
** Logical inverse of expression.
* !(expr)
** Shorthand for (not (expr))

Commands:
* May effect either world state or dialog system state.
** dlgset: Modify dialog property

Dialog Properties:
* dlgtype
** Set the type of dialog box to use.
* portrait
