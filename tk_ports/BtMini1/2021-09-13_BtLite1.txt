BtLite:
* Like BtMini but with a chunked terrain system.

Chunks:
* 16x16*16
* Organized into 16x16x4 regions.
** Possibly 16x16x16 with the upper 12 chunk layers unused.

Chunk Format:
* Chunk Header (Bit-Packed)
* 1-256x 32-bits (up to 1K), voxel type data
* 4K: voxel-type indices.
* 512B: voxel "not air" bitmask (? generate on chunk-load).
* 4K: voxel occlusion bits (? generate on chunk-load)

The chunk will likely use either LZ4 or RP2 encoding.

The region would consist of:
* A header;
* A series of chunk offsets
* A compressed-chunk data data.

The region would be defined in terms of 16-byte cells, possibly with a cell bitmap.
