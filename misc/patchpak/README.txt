Add: Looking at it, the legal status of the instruments patches used here is uncertain (not entirely sure at this point where they came from; only that is has been shuffling around in some of my projects for over a decade, and not all data used in my testing is necessarily "in the clear" in terms of its legal status).

I may need to remove or cobble together a replacement if any issue comes up.
I will probably remove these files as soon as I feel it necessary to do so, as I don't want to be on anyones' bad side.
