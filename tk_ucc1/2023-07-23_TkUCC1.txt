Goal:
* Smaller, faster, and lower memory footprint C compiler.

Will focus more on keeping code size and memory footprint manageable, rather than on generating high-performance code.

Will aim to have a more conventional structure:
* Preproces, Parse, Compile, Codegen, Assemble, Link
* But, will not fully separate passes or stages.
* Will also avoid the use of temporary files.

Will aim to hopefully have a smaller code footprint than BGBCC.


'WOFF':
* Will use a fairly simplistic object format based on the WAD2 format.
* Will use a "compile to translation units and then link" strategy.

Will likely deal with the "address distance and displacement" issues by using explicit memory-model flags.
