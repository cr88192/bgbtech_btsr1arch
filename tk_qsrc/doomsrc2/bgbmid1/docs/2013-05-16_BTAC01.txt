Experimental block-based audio codec.
Encodes blocks of 64 samples into 256 bits (32 bytes).
At 44.1kHz this is 176kbps.
It can encode stereo using a "naive joint stereo" encoding.

Most block formats will encode a single center channel and will offset it for the left/right channel.

Basic Format 0:
	4 bit: Block-Mode (0)
    currently unused (12 bits, zeroed)
    16 bit min sample (center)
    16 bit max sample (center)
    8 bit left-center min (ssqrt)
    8 bit left-center max (ssqrt)
    64 Samples, 1 bits/sample (64 bits)
    16x 4-bit min (64 bits)
    16x 4-bit max (64 bits)
 
The 4-bit values interpolate between the full min/max for the block.
The 1-bit samples select between the min and max value for each sample.
 
Note: Interpolated values are linear, thus 0=0/15, 1=1/15, 2=2/15, ..., 14=14/15, 15=15/15
 
Bit packing is in low-high order, and multibyte values are little-endian.


Basic Format 1:
	4 bit: Block-Mode (1)
	currently unused (12 bits, zeroed)
	16 bit min sample (center)
	16 bit max sample (center)
	8 bit left-center min (ssqrt)
	8 bit left-center max (ssqrt)
	32x 2-bit sample (64 bits)
	32x 4-bit sample (128 bits)

This directly codes all samples, with the 4-bit values encoding even samples, and the 2-bit values encoding odd samples.

The 4-bit samples are encoded between the block min/max values, and the 2-bit samples between the prior/next sample.

Sample interpolation (2 bit samples):
0=prior sample, 1=next sample, 2=average, 3=quadratic interpolated value.


Basic Format 2:
	4 bit: Block-Mode (2)
	currently unused (12 bits, zeroed)
	16 bit min sample (center)
	16 bit max sample (center)
	8 bit left-center min (ssqrt)
	8 bit left-center max (ssqrt)
	32x 6-bit samples (192 bits)

This directly codes samples, with the 6-bit values encoding samples.
The 6-bit samples are encoded between the block min/max values.

This mode encodes even samples, with odd-samples being interpolated (quadratic).
The last sample is extrapolated.


Stereo Format 3:
	4 bit: Block-Mode (3)
	currently unused (12 bits, zeroed)
	16 bit min sample (center)
	16 bit max sample (center)
	8 bit side min (truncated)
	8 bit side max (truncated)
	16x 4-bit side (64 bits)
	32x 4-bit sample (128 bits)

This directly codes samples, with the 4-bit values encoding even samples.
The 4-bit side value encodes the side channel.

The 4-bit samples are encoded between the block min/max values, and the 4-bit side samples between the side min/max.


Basic Format 4:
	4 bit: Block-Mode (4)
	currently unused (12 bits, zeroed)
	16 bit min sample (center)
	16 bit max sample (center)
	8 bit left-center min (ssqrt)
	8 bit left-center max (ssqrt)
	8x 4-bit min (32 bits)
	8x 4-bit max (32 bits)
	64x 2-bit sample (128 bits)

The 4-bit values interpolate between the full min/max for the block.
The 2-bit samples interpolate between the min and max values for each sub-block (0=min, 1=1/3, 2=2/3, 3=max).
