Idea:
* Another attempt at an x86 userland emulator.
* Try to make something which will hopefully be "viable".
** Optimize for BJX2 to what extent possible.
* Leverage TestKern's virtual memory support.
** Will map x86 userland to a contiguous region of address space.

Possible Sub-Goals:
* Full Emulation
* Real Mode and 16-bit protected Mode
