TkClib2:
* A redesigned C library.

Idea is that the C library will be partially split into a "frontend" and "backend" part. The frontend will be statically linked to the binary in question, whereas the backend part may be shared across multiple binaries.

The frontend and backend parts will be connected via contexts and VTables.
